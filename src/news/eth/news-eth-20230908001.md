### Introduction not finish xxxxx

In a rapidly evolving financial landscape, the global regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies and
blockchain technology is becoming increasingly pivotal. As countries grapple with the integration of
these digital assets into their economies, regulatory decisions can have profound implications on
market dynamics. From the U.S. Treasury Department's new tax guidance for crypto exchanges to the
SEC's stance on Bitcoin ETFs, these regulatory moves are shaping the future of the crypto industry.
Concurrently, economic indicators from major economies, technological advancements in Ethereum's
competitors, and global economic trends are all interplaying to influence the cryptocurrency market,
potentially driving a 1% increase in ETH price.

### **Global Regulatory Stance**

- **Long-Awaited Bitcoin Accounting Rules to Capture Rises:** US accounting standard-setters unanimously approved a new rule that requires companies that hold or invest in Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies to measure their assets at fair value. The new rule will take effect in **2025**, but companies can adopt it early. The new rule will improve the current practice, which treats digital currencies as intangible assets. The new rule only covers digital assets that are based on blockchain technology and secured by cryptography, and are interchangeable. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), stablecoins and wrapped tokens are excluded.

- **Global Standard Setters to Deliver Global Crypto Policy Roadmap:**  The Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will release a joint report on global cryptocurrency policy at this weekend’s G20 summit. The report includes a roadmap for implementing a policy framework for cryptocurrencies that includes global coordination, cooperation, and information sharing. The report was written at India’s request, which is the G20 presidency. The report is a response to the need for a **comprehensive policy response** to the risks posed by cryptocurrencies. The letter mentions events such as the bankruptcy of cryptocurrency exchange FTX and the collapse of stablecoin terraUSD, highlighting the **fragility** of cryptocurrencies and the need for close monitoring as connections between cryptocurrencies and the wider financial system grow. The report will emphasize the amplified macro-financial risks that emerging markets and developing economies may face, which may increase the need for targeted measures.

- **Following SEC delays, ARK Invest and 21Shares file for spot Ether ETF:**  Ark Invest and 21Shares have applied to the SEC to list an Ethereum spot ETF called ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF, which will be custodied by Coinbase. The ETF’s performance will be measured against the CME CF Ether-Dollar Reference Rate. The SEC is currently reviewing Ark Invest and 21Shares’ Bitcoin spot ETF and announced on **August 31** that it was delaying decisions on whether to approve or reject Bitcoin spot ETF applications from seven firms, including the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock. Ark Invest and 21Shares’ Bitcoin spot ETF is not on the delay list because its next deadline is **November 11**.

### Technology Advancement

- **Blockchain Privacy and Regulatory Compliance: Towards a Practical Equilibrium:** Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of the Ethereum network, and four co-authors propose a new privacy-enhancing protocol for blockchain called **privacy pools** that can distinguish honest users from criminals on blockchain protocols. Privacy pools are a smart contract-based privacy-enhancing protocol that allows users to protect their transaction data while proving that their funds are not from illicit sources. By pooling honest transactions together, users can demonstrate their membership in a **good-only** set. The paper suggests that privacy and regulatory compliance are not necessarily incompatible, if the privacy-enhancing protocol enables users to prove certain properties regarding the origin of their funds. The paper also aims to show that these innovations can comply with regulations.
- **MetaMask now allows crypto cash-out to PayPal and banks:** MetaMask, a popular self-custodial wallet for cryptocurrencies, has added the option for users to convert ETH into fiat currencies like USD and withdraw them to their bank accounts or PayPal. Self-custodial wallets allow users to have full control over their digital assets, but they are usually hard to use and require technical skills. MetaMask aims to make them more user-friendly and accessible. The cash-out feature involves paying gas fees to the network and transaction fees to third-party providers like **Moonpay**. The feature is currently available in the **U.S., the U.K. and parts of Europe**, with plans to expand to more regions.

### Technology Advancement in the Competitors of ETH

- **Visa Expands Stablecoin Settlement Capabilities to Merchant Acquirers:** Visa has announced that it is expanding its stablecoin settlement capabilities to the **Solana** blockchain and is working with merchant acquirers Worldpay and Nuvei. The company has already moved millions of USDC between its partners over the Solana and Ethereum blockchain networks to settle fiat-denominated payments authorized over VisaNet. By leveraging stablecoins like USDC and global blockchain networks like Solana and Ethereum, Visa is helping to improve the speed of cross-border settlement and providing a modern option for its clients to easily send or receive funds from Visa’s treasury.

### Economic Outlook and Trends

- **Coinbase Announces Interim Results and Extension and Upsizing of Cash Tender Offer for its Outstanding 3.625% Senior Notes Due 2031:** Coinbase announces interim results and changes of its offer to buy back some of its 3.625% Senior Notes due 2031 for cash.
Coinbase’s changes to the offer: Coinbase increases the maximum amount of cash it will pay from $150 million to $180 million and extends the deadline of the offer from **September 1, 2023** to **September 18, 2023**.
- **LSE Group draws up plans for blockchain-based digital assets business:** The London Stock Exchange Group is planning to launch a new digital markets business that will use blockchain technology to enable trading of traditional financial assets, such as stocks and bonds. The company believes that blockchain technology can improve the efficiency, transparency and cost of buying, selling and holding financial assets. It also wants to offer a regulated platform that can comply with existing rules and standards.

### **Summary not finish xxxxxx**

The recent regulatory decisions, particularly from the U.S. Treasury Department and the SEC, reflect
a cautious yet progressive approach towards the integration of cryptocurrencies. The IRS's focus on
decentralized exchanges and NFTs, combined with the SEC's deliberation on Bitcoin ETFs, underscores
the growing significance of these assets in the financial ecosystem. Furthermore, economic
indicators from the U.S., China, and India, combined with technological advancements in Ethereum's
competitors like Solana, suggest a robust and dynamic global market. The confluence of these
factors, along with the increasing acceptance and integration of digital assets in various sectors,
positions Ethereum favorably, hinting at a potential 1% price surge in the near future.
