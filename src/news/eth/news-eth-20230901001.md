### **Introduction**

In a rapidly evolving financial landscape, the global regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies and
blockchain technology is becoming increasingly pivotal. As countries grapple with the integration of
these digital assets into their economies, regulatory decisions can have profound implications on
market dynamics. From the U.S. Treasury Department's new tax guidance for crypto exchanges to the
SEC's stance on Bitcoin ETFs, these regulatory moves are shaping the future of the crypto industry.
Concurrently, economic indicators from major economies, technological advancements in Ethereum's
competitors, and global economic trends are all interplaying to influence the cryptocurrency market,
potentially driving a 1% increase in ETH price.

### **Global Regulatory Stance**

1. **IRS Targets Decentralized Exchanges and NFTs:** The U.S. Treasury Department has released new
   tax guidance for crypto exchanges, wallet providers, and payment processors. This guidance, in
   response to the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, outlines crypto token reporting
   requirements for various ecosystem participants, effective from the 2025 tax year. Decentralized
   exchanges (DEXs), NFT trading platforms, and certain wallet providers are potentially classified
   as brokers, necessitating compliance with these regulations. The rules encompass all digital
   assets, including stablecoins and NFTs. However, crypto miners are exempt. The DeFi community has
   expressed concerns, suggesting these regulations might hinder the U.S. DeFi sector.
   1. The rule would define a broker as **"any person engaged in the business of effecting
      transactions in securities for the account of others."** This definition is broad enough to
      encompass DeFi platforms, which facilitate the exchange of cryptocurrency between users.
   2. **The rule would require brokers to collect and report information on all cryptocurrency
      transactions, including the identity of the parties involved, the amount of cryptocurrency
      exchanged, and the date and time of the transaction. This information would be reported to the
      IRS on Form 1099-K.**
   3. The rule would take effect in **2026**. Now it’s in proposal. However, the Treasury Department
      and the IRS have said that they may implement the rule sooner if they receive enough public
      support.
2. **SEC Delays Spot Bitcoin ETF Decisions: The court determined that the SEC's rejection of
   Grayscale's proposed bitcoin ETF was "arbitrary and capricious" since the assets involved—bitcoin
   and bitcoin futures—are closely correlated, and the surveillance measures in place are
   consistent.** According to the **court judgement** that supported crypto asset management company
   **Grayscale**, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its evaluation of
   multiple **spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF)** applications. This delay affects major firms
   such as BlackRock, Wisdom Tree Funds, Invesco, Galaxy Digital, and Valkyrie Funds. The SEC has
   extended the decision deadline to at least **October 17**, with the exception of the Global X
   application, which has a deadline of October 7. This decision comes after a court ruling in favor
   of Grayscale's efforts to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF. However, the SEC
   **retains the right to appeal the court's decision within 45 days**. Market analysts had
   anticipated these delays, highlighting the SEC's historical reluctance to approve spot Bitcoin
   ETFs due to concerns about fraud and market manipulation.
3. **SEBA Bank's Hong Kong Crypto Services Approval:** Swiss crypto-focused SEBA Bank has **secured
   an approval-in-principle** to from **Hong Kong**'s securities regulator. This preliminary
   approval brings the bank **closer** to offering virtual asset services in the prominent Asian
   financial hub. The move signifies a progressive stance by Hong Kong authorities towards
   integrating and regulating cryptocurrency services, potentially enhancing the region's position
   as a leading financial center in the evolving digital asset landscape.
4. **Nexo Introduces Crypto Mastercard for EEA Citizens:** Bulgarian decentralized lending platform,
   **Nexo, has launched a crypto-powered debit and credit Mastercard exclusively for the European
   Economic Area (EEA) citizens.** The Nexo Card permits users to spend their stablecoins in euro,
   U.S. dollar, and British pound through debit transactions at over 100 million global merchant
   terminals. The card offers up to 9% annual interest on stored balances. **For credit
   transactions, major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin serve as collateral**, providing up to 2% cash
   back and 16% annual interest rates on utilized credit lines. Nexo emphasizes that assets under
   their custody are insured by Ledger and Bakkt. The card, both virtual and physical, is compatible
   with Apple Pay and Google Pay.
5. **Uniswap Class Action Dismissed:** A class action lawsuit against Uniswap was dismissed by Judge
   Katherine Polk Failla, who found certain claims lacking factual support. **The plaintiffs had
   alleged that Uniswap, its founder Hayden Adams, Andreessen Horowitz, and Paradigm were
   accountable for "rampant fraud" on the exchange and that Uniswap had offered and sold
   unregistered securities. The judge highlighted the decentralized nature of the protocol, which
   makes the identities of the Scam Token issuers unidentifiable.** The court emphasized that the
   current state of cryptocurrency regulation does not provide plaintiffs with a clear recourse,
   suggesting that concerns should be directed to Congress rather than the court. The ruling also
   compared the situation to holding an app like Venmo liable for a drug deal, emphasizing that the
   platform isn't at fault, but the individual misusing it is.
6. **Gaia-X moveID Project's Decentralized Identity for Vehicles:** MoveID, a mobility identity
   project initiated by 19 companies and spearheaded by Bosch, is set to showcase its first demo at
   the IAA MOBILITY 2023, Europe's premier auto fair. This **German government-endorsed**
   initiative, part of the GAIA-X association, employs self-sovereign identity (SSI) to ensure data
   privacy and facilitate autonomous vehicle transactions. Blockchain serves as a neutral
   infrastructure to **support transactions between vehicles, traffic systems, and service
   providers**. The moveID demo at the Munich auto show will feature the MOBIX app, which currently
   facilitates peer-to-peer parking and charging for Jaguar and Tesla electric vehicles. The app
   aids in locating and using electric charging points in a decentralized manner, allowing
   businesses to offer their parking spaces for electric vehicle charging, with in-car digital
   wallets handling the associated fees.
7. **Utility Tokens for Digital Wallet Scheme in Thailand:** The Pheu Thai-led government of
   Thailand is in discussions with the Bank of Thailand regarding the implementation of the Utility
   Token Type 1 as a payment method for the "digital wallet" scheme. These utility tokens, which
   grant access to specific products or services within a blockchain ecosystem, are being considered
   for the scheme. However, since the central bank does not recognize these tokens as a legal
   payment method, modifications to the Digital Assets Executive Decree are required. The process of
   establishing a blockchain ecosystem for this scheme is intricate and time-consuming,
   necessitating a thorough KYC (know your customer) procedure. Under this scheme, every Thai
   citizen aged 16 and above will be eligible to receive 10,000 baht in digital currency, likely in
   the form of utility tokens. These tokens must be spent within six months at stores within a 4km
   radius of the user's residence and cannot be converted to cash or used to settle debts. The
   funding for this initiative is expected to come from various sources, including tax collections
   for the fiscal year 2024 and potential government borrowing.

### **Technology Advancement in the Competitors of ETH**

- **Solana's Integration with Shopify for USDC Payments:** Solana Labs' decentralized payment
  protocol, Solana Pay, has partnered with Shopify, allowing businesses to accept payments in USDC
  stablecoins. This move emphasizes Solana's vision of its blockchain being ideal for payments,
  highlighting speed, reduced fees, and the elimination of intermediaries.

### **Economic Outlook and Trends**

- **Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's Jackson Hole Speech:** Powell indicated potential further
  interest rate hikes and emphasized the Fed's commitment to monitoring economic growth and labor
  market conditions. The Federal Reserve's benchmark lending rate reached its highest in 22 years,
  reflecting concerns about inflation.
- **Revised US Economic Growth for Q2:** The US economy's Q2 growth rate was revised to 2.1%, down
  from the initial 2.4%. Despite the downward revision, the economy's growth remains positive, and
  the slower pace is seen as beneficial in managing inflation.
- **China's Stimulus to Revive Property Market:** China introduced measures to ease home buying,
  potentially impacting $3.5 trillion in mortgages. The new regulations reduce down payment
  requirements and adjust mortgage rates, aiming to rescue the property market from a historic
  downturn.
- **India's Economic Growth in April-June Quarter:** India's economy grew by 7.8% in the April-June
  quarter, driven by robust services activity and strong demand. However, concerns arise from the
  drier than usual monsoon season, which could potentially impact future growth.

### **Summary**

The recent regulatory decisions, particularly from the U.S. Treasury Department and the SEC, reflect
a cautious yet progressive approach towards the integration of cryptocurrencies. The IRS's focus on
decentralized exchanges and NFTs, combined with the SEC's deliberation on Bitcoin ETFs, underscores
the growing significance of these assets in the financial ecosystem. Furthermore, economic
indicators from the U.S., China, and India, combined with technological advancements in Ethereum's
competitors like Solana, suggest a robust and dynamic global market. The confluence of these
factors, along with the increasing acceptance and integration of digital assets in various sectors,
positions Ethereum favorably, hinting at a potential 1% price surge in the near future.
