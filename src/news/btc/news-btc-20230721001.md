### **Introduction**

In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, the regulatory landscape plays a pivotal role in
shaping the market dynamics. Recent developments across the globe, from security breaches to
regulatory updates, have the potential to significantly impact the price of Bitcoin, the leading
cryptocurrency. This article predicts **1% appreciation in Bitcoin's price** **from July 22-28,
2023,** delves into these developments, including the exploits of Multichain vulnerabilities, the
UK's Financial Conduct Authority's updated regulations on financial investment product promotions,
and the U.S. Senate's proposed Crypto-Asset National Security Enhancement Act of 2023. We also
explore the anticipated integration of the Lightning Network into the Bitcoin ecosystem and the
potential impact of global economic trends on Bitcoin's value.

### **Global Regulatory Stance**

In the global regulatory landscape, recent developments could potentially influence Bitcoin's price.

Recent security breaches involving **Multichain**, a protocol enabling asset transfers across
different blockchains, could potentially influence Bitcoin's price. Two incidents saw **unknown
entities exploit Multichain vulnerabilities, transferring assets from MPC addresses to undisclosed
locations, with the total value of assets reaching approximately $226 million.** The inability of
the Multichain team to prevent or recover these assets, due to the seizure of their **CEO's devices
by Chinese authorities**, coupled with the lack of an official statement regarding the second
incident, has led to speculation and suspicion among the online community.

The **UK**'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has updated its regulations concerning the promotion
of financial investment products (**memes token**) on social media. The new rules target content
that exaggerates potential profits, fails to clearly indicate the complexity and risks of investment
products, and does not clearly distinguish between legally protected and unprotected aspects of a
product. The regulations also cover cryptocurrency markets and any areas involving risk-bearing
profit channels.

In **the United States**, the Senate is considering a new bill that would impose stringent
anti-money laundering (AML) requirements on decentralized finance (**DeFi**) protocols. The
Crypto-Asset National Security Enhancement Act of 2023 would **require DeFi protocols to impose
bank-like controls on their user base.** The bill aims to combat the rise in crypto-facilitated
crime and close off avenues for the evasion of money laundering and sanctions measures. This could
potentially increase the demand for Bitcoin as a more secure and regulated alternative to DeFi
protocols.

The proposed U.S. Senate bill, the Crypto-Asset National Security Enhancement Act of 2023, aims to
bring decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols under a regulatory framework similar to that of
traditional banks. Here are some of the key provisions:

**Customer Verification**: The bill would require entities controlling DeFi protocols to vet and
collect information on their customers. This is akin to the Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations
that banks must adhere to, which involve verifying the identity of their clients and assessing
potential risks of illegal intentions for the business relationship.

**Anti-Money Laundering Programs**: Entities controlling DeFi protocols would be required to
maintain anti-money laundering (AML) programs. These programs are designed to prevent and **detect
the practice of generating income through illegal actions and making the origins of that income
appear legitimate**.

**Reporting Suspicious Activity**: Similar to traditional financial institutions, entities
controlling DeFi protocols would be required to report suspicious activity to the government. This
could include transactions that are unusually large or appear to have no legitimate purpose.

**Blocking Sanctioned Individuals**: The bill would require entities controlling DeFi protocols to
prevent individuals on sanctions lists from using their protocol. This is similar to the obligations
of banks to comply with international sanctions.

**Responsibility for Protocol Development**: If no one controls a DeFi protocol, the bill proposes
that anyone who invests more than $25 million in developing the protocol would be responsible for
these obligations.

**Identity Verification for Crypto Kiosks**: The bill would also place identity verification
requirements on crypto kiosks, similar to the requirements for traditional **ATMs**.

These developments in the regulatory environment, coupled with the recent security breaches
involving Multichain, could potentially drive a shift in investor sentiment towards more secure
cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, possibly leading to a predicted 1% appreciation in its price.

### **Bitcoin overview**

One of the most anticipated developments in the Bitcoin ecosystem is the integration of the
Lightning Network, a layer-two solution that enables fast and cheap transactions on top of the
blockchain. **The Lightning Network** has been gaining traction among users and developers, and
recently, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, **Binance, announced that it
will support it on its platform.** This is a significant milestone for the adoption and innovation
of Bitcoin, as it will allow millions of users to access the benefits of the Lightning Network and
potentially increase the demand and value of the native currency. Based on this news, we can expect
a modest but positive impact on the Bitcoin price in the short term, as more users and merchants
will be able to use it as a medium of exchange and store of value. We estimate that the Bitcoin
price could appreciate by 1% in the next week, as the market reacts to this development and
anticipates further growth and innovation in the Bitcoin space.

### **Economic Outlook and Trends**

The global economic landscape is changing rapidly, and Bitcoin is poised to benefit from these
shifts. Here are some of the key factors that could boost the value of the leading cryptocurrency in
the near future.

First, **the US unemployment rate has dropped to 5.4% in July, the lowest level since March 2020.**
This indicates that the labor market is recovering from the pandemic-induced slump and that consumer
confidence is rising. A stronger US economy could increase the demand for Bitcoin as an alternative
store of value and a hedge against inflation.

Second, the **UK mortgage rates have fallen for the first time in months. The average two-year fixed
rate dropped by 0.03 percentage points to 2.52%, while the average five-year fixed rate fell by 0.02
percentage points to 2.79%.** This could make homeownership more affordable for many Britons and
free up some disposable income for other investments, such as Bitcoin.

Third, the **UK inflation rate has slid to 7.9% in June, below expectations and down from 8.2% in
May.** This suggests that the spike in consumer prices caused by supply chain disruptions and higher
energy costs may be easing. A lower inflation rate could reduce the pressure on the Bank of England
to raise interest rates and tighten monetary policy, which could support the growth of Bitcoin and
other risk assets.

### **Summary**

The global regulatory landscape is witnessing significant changes that could potentially influence
Bitcoin's price. Recent security breaches involving Multichain have led to speculation and suspicion
among the online community, potentially driving a shift in investor sentiment towards more secure
cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Regulatory updates from the UK's Financial Conduct Authority and the
U.S. Senate's proposed bill could further impact the cryptocurrency market. The integration of the
Lightning Network into the Bitcoin ecosystem is a significant milestone that could increase the
demand and value of Bitcoin. Additionally, global economic trends, such as the US unemployment rate,
UK mortgage rates, and UK inflation rate, could also influence Bitcoin's value. These developments
collectively suggest a potential 1% appreciation in Bitcoin's price in the near future.
