### **Introduction**

Bitcoin, the world's leading cryptocurrency, has been a beacon of innovation and financial freedom
since its inception. However, like any asset, it is not immune to fluctuations in value. This
article aims to shed light on the potential **1% depreciation in Bitcoin's price** **from July
15-21, 2023**, examining the global regulatory stance, technological advancements, and economic
outlook.

### **Global Regulatory Stance**

The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies has been a roller coaster ride, with several
significant developments recently. Celsius Network, a prominent player in the crypto lending space,
is facing multiple lawsuits from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC alleges
that Celsius Network, along with its founder Alex Mashinsky, violated federal securities laws. This
development has sent shockwaves through the crypto community, potentially impacting investor
sentiment and Bitcoin's price.

The global regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies has been a tumultuous journey, with numerous
significant developments recently that have the potential to impact Bitcoin's value. One of the most
prominent instances is the legal challenges faced by **Celsius Network**, a leading player in the
crypto lending space. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed multiple lawsuits
against the company and its founder, Alex Mashinsky. The SEC alleges that Celsius Network has
violated federal securities laws by offering unregistered securities to its customers. This
development has sent shockwaves through the crypto community, potentially influencing investor
sentiment and causing a ripple effect on Bitcoin's price.

In addition to Celsius, **FTX**, a bankrupt crypto exchange, has recently launched an online claims
portal for its creditors. The **portal** allowed users of FTX and its subsidiaries to access their
account balances as of Nov. 11, 2022, the day FTX filed for bankruptcy in the US, and to submit
claims for consideration in the firm's restructuring proceedings. Also, former FTX CEO Sam
Bankman-Fried is facing a criminal trial for fraud allegations in October.

Ripple Labs Inc faced a mixed ruling from a U.S. judge on Thursday, July 13, 2023, regarding its XRP
digital token. **The judge decided that Ripple's sales of XRP to institutional investors were
illegal because they were unregistered investment contracts under federal securities law.** However,
the judge also dismissed some claims from the SEC and **said that XRP was not a security when sold
to the general public**. "Institutional Buyers would have understood that Ripple was pitching a
speculative value proposition for XRP with potential profits to be derived from Ripple’s
entrepreneurial and managerial efforts," Judge Analisa Torres wrote in her ruling. Ripple's CEO Brad
Garlinghouse expressed his gratitude for the decision on Twitter, saying that it was "for all crypto
innovation in the US.”

These instances of regulatory actions against major players in the crypto space highlight the
increasing scrutiny that the industry is facing. As regulators worldwide attempt to catch up with
the rapid growth and innovation in the crypto market, such developments could lead to increased
volatility and potential price depreciation for Bitcoin. Therefore, it is crucial for investors to
closely monitor these regulatory developments as they could significantly impact their investment in
Bitcoin and the broader crypto market.

### **Bitcoin overview**

Bitcoin **mining difficulty reached an all-time high of 53.91 trillion units after the latest
adjustment on July 12**. This measure indicates how challenging it is to mine Bitcoin blocks. The
blockchain adjusts its difficulty every two weeks to maintain a processing time of 10 minutes.

Bitcoin whales, investors holding between 10 to 10,000 BTC, have increased their holdings by $2.15
billion since June 17. Bitcoin held by exchanges has also fallen below 2017 levels, suggesting that
**investors are moving the BTC off exchange and increasing its illiquid supply**.

Despite the accumulation of Bitcoin among whales, the price of BTC has remained suppressed in a
narrow range between $29,500 and $31,500, which could partially be due to **miner selling
pressure**.

### **Economic Outlook and Trends**

**Inflation in the U.S. rose just 0.2%** in June 2023, less than expected, as consumers got a break
from price increases. The annual inflation rate fell to **3%**, the lowest level since March 2021.
The article cited soft gains in food prices and declines in used vehicle and airline prices as
factors that helped keep inflation down, while shelter prices continued to rise. Worker wages
adjusted for inflation increased **1.2%** from a year ago. Lower inflation reduces the demand for
alternative assets that hedge against currency devaluation.

The **US** Navy flew a P-8A Poseidon plane through the **Taiwan Strait** on July 13, 2023, after
**China** staged war games around Taiwan earlier this month. The US move was seen as a show of
support for Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory. A French lawmaker confirmed that a
**French warship** had recently transited the strait as well. It could have a negative impact on the
BTC price, as it indicates a heightened risk of military conflict in the region. BTC is sensitive to
geopolitical uncertainty, as it **affects the demand and supply of the cryptocurrency**. A possible
scenario is that investors would sell BTC to seek safer assets, such as gold or fiat currencies, in
case of a war outbreak. This would lower the BTC price by reducing its liquidity and increasing its
volatility.

### **Summary**

In conclusion, a multitude of factors could contribute to a potential 1% depreciation in Bitcoin's
price. The evolving regulatory landscape, technological advancements in Bitcoin mining, and broader
economic trends all play a role. While Bitcoin has proven resilient in the face of challenges, these
factors warrant close monitoring for any investor in the cryptocurrency space. As always, it is
crucial to stay informed and make investment decisions based on a comprehensive understanding of the
market dynamics.

However, this prediction is subject to many uncertainties and assumptions, and should not be taken
as financial advice.
